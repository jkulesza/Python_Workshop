This repository contains examples (both simple and complex) that are intended to
supplement classroom instruction in introductory Python.  The contents include:

1. `Plotting_XS_Data` --- Simple and more complicated (but more aesthetically-pleasing) line plots of various Fe-56 cross section data.
2. `Monte_Carlo_Pi` --- A Monte Carlo calculation of $\pi$ with examples for plotting scatter plots and histograms.
