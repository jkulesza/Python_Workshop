This repository contains examples (both simple and complex) that are intended to
supplement classroom instruction in introductory Python.  The contents include:

1. `Plot_Gallery` --- Reasonably straightforward plotting scripts using simple data to show different plot stylings and output considerations.
2. `Plot_XS_Data` --- Simple and more complicated (but more aesthetically-pleasing) line plots of various Fe-56 cross section data.  Here we look at some advanced plot techniques but also advanced plot styling.
2. `Monte_Carlo_Pi` --- A Monte Carlo calculation of $\pi$ with examples for plotting scatter plots and histograms.  There is also a demonstration of more advanced line plotting using basic styling.
